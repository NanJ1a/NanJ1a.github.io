Nan Jia is a builder, storyteller, and lifelong learner. With an engineering background and hands-on experience in entrepreneurship and content creation, I enjoy taking ideas from concept to execution. Whether it’s managing projects, creating videos, or designing experiences, I bring energy, ownership, and creativity to everything I do.
